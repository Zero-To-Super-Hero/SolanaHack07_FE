# Create events as nft collections and tickets as nft tokens in those collections

Our team's project is: A platform to support event organizers in creating events and event tickets, and subsequently, facilitating the airdrop of gifts or allowing users to exchange gifts using NFTs purchased from the events.

BE: Build a database and API center for calling and updating purchase status using C# with SQL Server.

After our team finishes the BE, we will switch to working on the FE.
